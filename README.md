Side Note: I really enjoyed making this project! I challenged myself to dive deeper into CSS to learn more about mobile responsiveness best practices, keyframe animations, and SASS! I always felt like Javascript and its respective frameworks were a strong suit of mine, so I wanted to try to improve my skills to make a more pleasent user experience!
